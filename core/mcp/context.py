"""`QueryContext` — the small read-only seam the MCP tools depend on.

Every MCP query/discovery tool used to reach into `ResolvedConfig`'s concrete shape
directly (`config.environments.values()`, `config.store`, `config.dashboard_packs`,
the `_enabled_envs`/`_require_env`/`_sources_providing` module helpers). That made a
test of one tool construct a whole `ResolvedConfig`. `QueryContext` is the deep seam
that fixes it: it exposes exactly the handful of operations the tools need over the
resolved config, so the tools depend on this small interface rather than the config's
shape — and a test can drive context behavior from a MINIMAL hand-built config.

The interface is intentionally SMALL (the review flagged over-engineering risk): it
carries only methods a tool actually uses — the enabled-env walk, single-env
resolution (raising the existing clear `CapabilityError`), capability-filtered source
selection, the store, the dashboard-pack catalog, and the all-envs/env-names faces
the signal catalog needs (which include disabled envs, unlike the fetch walk).

IMPORTANT (FastMCP / PEP-563): this module must NOT add
`from __future__ import annotations` — it lives under `core/mcp/`, and deferred
annotations break FastMCP's schema generation for the tool returns that consume it.

        answer PromQL (a `passthrough` store → `CapabilityError`) is SWALLOWED to `None` so the
        calling tool (`get_cluster_state` / `get_cost` / `get_slo` / `describe_health`) stays
        answerable from the store's "no data" rather than crashing into the MCP surface.

        Returns `None`, NEVER an invented `0.0`, when there is no data — so a caller chooses
        `read_gauge(...) or 0.0` only where a zero default is the intended semantic (the cost /

        map, the `compare_envs` per-env comparison). Unlike `read_gauge`, it PROPAGATES a
        `CapabilityError` — `compare_envs`'s fan-out depends on a per-env outage surfacing so the
        env is marked down, not silently treated as an empty result.

        Like `read_gauge`, it OWNS the F7 escape: `escape_promql_value(env)` is applied
        unconditionally, so a quote-bearing env stays a single closed selector string. It is
        ALSO self-defending on the `metric` NAME: `metric` is spliced UNQUOTED into the

        `CapabilityError` on a breakout name) rather than trusting every caller to pre-validate.
