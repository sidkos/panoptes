"""The `http-health` source — probes an HTTP `/health` endpoint into gauge metrics.

`fetch` issues a single GET against the configured `url`, times the round-trip, and
emits two derived gauge `MetricSignal`s (spec `## Data Model` → Derived metrics):

| Metric | Value | Labels (exact) |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| `panoptes_health_up` | `1.0` on a 2xx/3xx response, `0.0` otherwise | `env`, `url` |
| `panoptes_health_latency_ms` | the measured request latency in milliseconds | `env`, `url` |

"Down" covers three failure shapes — connection refused, timeout, and a 5xx
status — and **all three still record a latency** (the time spent before the
failure) so a Grafana latency panel is never blank during an outage. `_up` is
`0.0` for every down shape.

`env` is mandatory on every signal (model invariant). The source is configured
per-environment, so it reads its own `env` from the config block: the loader builds
one source instance per env and threads the env into each block. This adapter
consumes a flat `env` config field rather than coupling to a Phase-1 loader change
(Phase-7 YAML/loader wiring supplies it; tests pass it directly).

This adapter is the LIGHT delegate to `core.rest`: it shares only the injectable
`httpx.Client` construction seam (via `RestClient`). It deliberately does NOT use the
shared raise/failure-surfacing path, because a probe failure is NOT an error to raise
— every down shape (5xx / connection-refused / timeout) must map to `up=0.0` with a
latency still recorded, not a `PanoptesError`. So it drives the raw client and keeps
its own up/down branching.

httpx is mocked in tests with `respx`, which patches the transport globally, so the
`RestClient`'s default `httpx.Client()` is intercepted without an injected client; the
client is still threaded as a constructor seam for explicit control.
